CODENAME Hydro Unit Models

CODE INTRO
Description: This software package includes hydrogovernor and turbine models developed in Simulink (The Mathworks, Inc.) and RSCAD (RTDS Technologies Inc.) 
for low-head bulb-style Kaplan turbine hydropower plants. The model developed in Simulink has been designed and tuned to match the governor-turbine 
response for a real-world run-of-river (ROR) hydropower unit owned by Idaho Falls Power (IFP). The Simulink and RSCAD models enable real-time testing in a hardware-in-the-loop
(HIL) implementation using OPAL-RT and RTDS digital real-time simulators, respectively. An automatic initialization for dynamic simulation has also been 
integrated to each model in both Simulink and RSCAD. The RSCAD initialization involves a novel python based interfacing for automatic modification of 
the initial conditions in the model. The parameters of these models can be tuned to match other hydropower plants in this class.


MODEL BENEFITS
This high-fidelity model will enable capturing dynamic behavior of a low-head bulb-style Kaplan turbine â€“ specially in an islanded mode of operation. 
This is critical to assess the associated electromechanical instability (sustained or ceasing)  properly so that an effective and efficient mitigation 
(such as sizing an energy storage to be integrated) scheme can be analyzed off-line, validated and de-risked through digital real-time simulation, and
 deployed with the particular hydropower unit.
