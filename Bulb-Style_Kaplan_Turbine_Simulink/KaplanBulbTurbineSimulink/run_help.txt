
H6E MODEL DEVELOPEMENT IN SIMULINK (following American governor Matlab model)




========== Run in Grid Connected Mode (test field data results) ===========
Generator : Modeled as swing equation equivalent 
1. Run initialization - load the .m files (AB_init, AB_load,data) into initFcn. The initial values (s1-s11) are stored in the workspace in the variable (s), then loaded into the integrators and tf's in the model to specify init conds
2. Override  the values of (Kp,Ki,Kd,bbias,delec,ke) in AB_load_data.m 
3. Specify Pinit, Plocal(MW) in the model callbacks
4. Set the step pref change inputs
5. Adjust time step to t=0.005 and RUN!



========== Run in Isolated Mode ===========
1. Run initialization - load the .m files (AB_init, AB_load,data) into initFcn. The initial values (s1-s11) are stored in the workspace in the variable (s), then loaded into the integrators and tf's in the model to specify init conds
2. Override  the values of (Kp,Ki,Kd,bbias,delec,ke) in AB_load_data.m
3. Specify Pinit, Plocal(MW) accordingly in the model callbacks
4. Apply step change to Plocal in Simulink model 
5. Adjust time step to t=0.01 and RUN!



========== Run in SG machine connected isolated Mode ===========
1. Run initialization - load the .m files (AB_init, AB_load,data) into initFcn. The initial values (s1-s11) are stored in the workspace in the variable (s), then loaded into the integrators and tf's in the model to specify init conds
2. Specify the values of (Kp,Ki,Kd,bbias,delec,ke) in AB_load_data.m (for isolated mode)
3. Change time step to (t=2.5e-5) and RUN!




**** Run one subsystem at once and comment out others -Running multiple together will cause variables replication error 

**** Note that the second characterizer used in Matlab code is different from the one shown in his block diagram from by AG. It should actually be (qgv,pgv) flow vs. power. The values of qgv have been updated in the second characterizer

**** Note that the position of Kp in the governor PID control is incorrect in the block diagram provided by AG. Following the Matlab code, Kp should be on the error signal - the modification has been done in the Simulink model

***** Derivative gain has been added in governor. Has been implemented in two ways, following the code, and other the standard way of taking derivative of input signal with constant gain

***** Speed feedback loop in the turbine has not be used in the code, and thus removed from the turbine input parameters
